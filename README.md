<br/>
<p>
 🧠 I am a full stack developer with a passion for building modern, robust and scalable web and mobile applications. I learn fast and I like to learn new things and find solutions by myself.
  With a strong aesthetic sense and focused on code quality, attention to detail and UX/UI are essential elements in my way of understanding development.
</p>

<p>
 💜 I consider myself an empathetic and team worker who lives by the maxim that people (or the team) come first. I love dealing with and meeting new people.
  For that very reason I am passionate about everything related to team management and its synergies, dynamics and work methodologies, and over time I would like to continue learning in that direction. People are the most precious resource.

  <h2>🛠️ Current Project:</h2>
</div>
<p>
  I'm currently working together with my team at <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/"><b></b>Assembler Institute</b></a> on a music app, with some artist music in the style of Spotify, but with the built-in functionality of being able to upload your own music, either publicly or privately, in the style of SoundCloud.
  The project is done in React + TypeScript with Vite.js for the front end, and PostgreSQL + Express + Prisma for the back end, integrating @Auth0 for user authentication and Cloudinary for asset storage, among other libraries and resources.

<h2 align="center">🌱 Learning Journey</h2>
<p>
  I am currently on a learning journey at <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/">Assembler Institute</a>, exploring various aspects of Full Stack development, soft skills and work environment and working methodologies. But my concerns do not end there:<br/>
  <ul>
    <li>I am learning, in a self-taught way and through some free courses, everything I can about SCRUM and agile methodologies</li>
    <li>I'm learning, self-taught and through some free courses, everything I can about prompt engineering and AI.</li>
    <li>I'm learning and practicing a lot with Figma, as well as other design tools, to get more solid designs and make the front end styling process faster and more robust (https://lnkd.in/ddpSKa87). </li>
    <li>I am studying UI/UX on my own, because I consider that it is the ultimate goal of all development. Applications are built to be used.</li>
    <li>I am looking forward to consolidating my new knowledge to launch myself into new languages ​​and technologies. Step by step, but without pause...</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 align="center">💡 Interests</h2>
<p>
  There is life behind the code! My main interests and hobbies are:
  <ul>
    <li>🐾 My animals! Going to the mountains, the fields or the river with my dogs is something that makes me immensely happy.</li>
    <li>📜 Reading is another fundamental pillar in my free time, especially sci-fi and fantasy. Lately I've been busy with EVERYTHING by Brandon Sanderson and, like everyone, dealing with Patrick Rothfuss and his little creative issues 😂.</li>
    <li>🦍 Last but not least, I have been practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 8 years. After a lot of effort and work, I am currently a purple belt. For me bjj is a necessity and a way of life.</li>
  </ul>
